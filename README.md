I referenced a premade bootstrap portfolio page to create my portfolio. It is Start Bootstrap - Freelancer v7.0.0 (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer).

I needed to change around different sections of the HTML, create my own CSS and get ride of the JS to create my personal page. But the way the Start Bootstrap created the modals I really liked, so I kept alot of that HTML code and mainly tweeked colors, pictures, and more.

## NAV BAR section
I used a basic nav bar layout from bootstrap and connected the links to different sections of the site. I needed the CSS

## MASTHEAD section

## PORTFOLIO section
**Steps I took to changing this code to better fit my portfolio.**

In the portfolio section of the website there is a section for 6 pictures with links to modals. 
* The first three modals I used to share my project one "Inspired Meals 4 You", Work Day Scheduler homework and the Weather Dashboard homeworks. 
* The next three modals I disapbled the modal button and the hover now says "Coming soon." I did put pictures representing 3 projects I'm hoping to work on during my spare time: An astronomy app, and fine arts locator app, and a vintage shopping app.

1. I changed the pictures to images that I felt represented a meal app, a calendar app and a weather app well.
2. I changed the hover feature to say the projects names instead of the "+" icon
3. Within each modal I updated:
    - the title to match my app
    - inserted a picture of the actual project website.
    - included a description of the assignment and how the sites were created
    - Also within the modal I added a button to link to the specific repositories on my GitHub page.
