I referenced a premade bootstrap portfolio page to create my portfolio. It is Start Bootstrap - Freelancer v7.0.0 (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer).

Languages used: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

I needed to change around different sections of the HTML, create my own CSS and get ride of the JS to create my personal page. But the way the Start Bootstrap created the modals I really liked, so I kept some of that HTML code and tweeked colors, pictures, margin, paddings and more.

## NAV BAR section
I used a basic nav bar layout from bootstrap and connected the links to different sections of the site. I needed the CSS to get my desired colors because I they could not be inserted into the HTML with bootstrap.
The BS navbar comes with built in CSS that changes the font of the nav links when you hover. I added another item to the navbar - Resume. This links and opens in a new page to a PDF of my updated portfolio that includes descriptions of three of my repositories and my current coding skills.

## ABOUT ME section
I liked the styling of the main image in the masthead section of the Freelance theme. I decided to combine that with the about me section. I placed my image and header into rows and then the text into two columns. Because I'm using bootstrap the columns will stack ontop of one another in mobile view. 
For the mobile media I did change the size of the About me header and all of the other section headers so the icons and the text would all be on the same line.

## PORTFOLIO section
**Steps I took to changing this code to better fit my portfolio.**
I really liked the way the modals were displayed in the Freelancer code and so for the modals themselves I didn't change to much of the html, only really color, backgroud, size, padding and margins.
In the portfolio section of the website there is a section for 6 pictures with links to modals. 
* The first three modals I used to share my project one "Inspired Meals 4 You", Work Day Scheduler homework and the Weather Dashboard homeworks. 
* The next three modals are for upcoming projects and the hover now says "Coming soon." I did put pictures representing 3 projects I'm hoping to work on during my spare time: An astronomy app, and fine arts locator app, and a vintage shopping app.

1. The modal links on the webpage are images I felt represented a meal app, a calendar app and a weather app well. I put the actual website images inside the modals
2. The hover feature changes the opacity of the pictures and when you click on them it takes you to the individual modal.

3. Within each modal I updated:
    - The title to match my app
    - Removed the X button on the top right of modal.
    - The font size & color, background color, margins and padding
    - Inserted a picture of the actual project website.
    - Included a description of the assignment and how the sites were created
    - Added two buttons before the close button:
        1. Git Hub: Links to the specific repositories on my GitHub page.
        2. Website: Links to the specific repository's website.

## CONTACT section
1. In my contact section I needed to include multiple ways to contact me: email, telephone, github, linkedIn. I decided to use features from the footer bar in the Freelancer. I prefered having my contact information in a single column with multiple rows instead of a row with multiple columns like freelancer. To link to my github and linkedIn pages, email and instagram I created a section called Contact Links and used the icons for these cites as my link. They have a hover feature that highlights them. I also created a section. I also created another section called Need More Info? and Here I included my phone number and encouraged people to contact me.

1. Below the CONTACT ME section is a footer bar with the simple job of taking the user back to the top of the page. I wanted to bring the light purple background back into the webpage and I thought placing it here would balance it out well.

Here is the hover feature for the footer
