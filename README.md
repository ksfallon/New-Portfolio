I used a premade bootstrap portfolio page to create my portfolio. It is Start Bootstrap - Freelancer v7.0.0 (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer).

## PORTFOLIO section
In the portfolio section of the website there is a section for 6 pictures with links to modals. 
* The first three modals I used to share my project one "Inspired Meals 4 You", Work Day Scheduler homework and the Weather Dashboard homeworks. 
* The next three modals I disapbled the modal button and the hover now says "Coming soon." I did put pictures representing 3 projects I'm hoping to work on during my spare time: An astronomy app, and fine arts locator app, and a vintage shopping app.

**Steps I took to changing this code to better fit my portfolio.**
1. I changed the pictures to images that I felt represented a meal app, a calendar app and a weather app well.
2. I changed the hover feature to say the projects names instead of the "+" icon
3. Within each modal I updated:
    - the title to match my app
    - inserted a picture of the actual project website.
    - included a description of the assignment and how the sites were created
    - Also within the modal I added a button to link to the specific repositories on my GitHub page.
